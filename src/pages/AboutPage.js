            <p>We know how hard an educatorâ€™s job is. </p>
            <p>
              Teachers are entrusted by society to prepare the next generation.
              They have numerous duties and responsibilities they must meet with
              scarce resources.

              who are already doing more than their share of duties such as
              child care, cooking, and cleaning without monetary compensation.
              Expecting a constant stream of new teachers to be pedagogical
              wizards is unrealistic.

              On the other hand, simply giving them a textbook to follow can be
              soul-deadening. This website will offer teaching resources that
              teachers can use right away and personalize for their own needs.
