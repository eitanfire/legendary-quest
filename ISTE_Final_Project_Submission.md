ISTE AI Deep Dive Course - Final Project: Option 2: Build a Learning Experience
1. LESSON OVERVIEW


Topic: Evaluating Different Perspectives on Westward Expansion
Grade Level: 6-8
Duration: 50 minutes
Standards: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.6-8.6 (Identify aspects of text that reveal author's point of view); CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.6-8.9 (Analyze relationship between primary and secondary sources)


Learning Objectives:
Students will analyze primary sources from westward expansion to identify and compare perspectives of settlers, Indigenous peoples, and Mexican citizens, evaluating how point of view shapes historical narratives.


Connection to Course Learning:
Throughout this course, my journal reflections kept returning to questions of bias in AI-generated content and whose voices get centered or erased. This guided my decision to design a lesson focused on multiple perspectives - both in the historical content and in how I use AI to design instruction.


2. AI INTEGRATION: WHERE AND HOW AI SUPPORTED THIS LESSON


I used TeachLeague (teachleague.com), an AI lesson planning tool I created and enhanced with AI literacy principles from this course. Here's how AI-supported design and differentiation:


Design Support: I entered my learning objective, selected grades 6-8 and CCSS standards, then the AI matched my topic to curriculum resources from a database of social studies courses and extracted primary sources, videos, and teaching materials I might not have found independently.


Differentiation: By selecting UDL strategies (visual aids, captions), the AI embedded accommodations throughout the lesson, ensuring accessibility for diverse learners.


Triple Filter Applied: The most important enhancement was requiring the AI to apply the course's Triple Filter framework:
Accuracy Filter: AI cites specific sources and flags uncertain claims with "[Verify: source needed]"
Bias Filter: AI explicitly identifies whose perspectives are represented and whose are missing
Relevance Filter: AI maps each activity to specific standard codes, ensuring genuine alignment


3. AI LITERACY LENS: ENSURING ACCURACY, RELEVANCE, AND STUDENT-CENTERED DESIGN


This course taught me that AI language models don't "know" history - they predict text patterns from training data, which means they can generate plausible-sounding but inaccurate claims, mirror biases, and can't verify outputs. Applying what I learned, I redesigned my AI tool to require transparency: the AI now cites sources and flags uncertain claims (Accuracy), explicitly identifies included and missing perspectives (Bias Awareness), and generates student literacy guides teaching when AI helps versus undermines learning (Student-Centered Design). For this westward expansion lesson, the AI's "Perspectives Analysis" explicitly stated which voices were represented (settler families, Cherokee Nation, Mexican citizens) and which were missing (Chinese railroad workers, African American cowboys, women's experiences), helping me make informed choices about what to add rather than unknowingly perpetuating bias.


4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: HOW STUDENTS WILL ENGAGE


Opening (10 min): Students view a video about Manifest Destiny and discuss: "Whose story is told? Whose is missing?" This activates critical thinking about perspective.


Introduction (15 min): Students receive a graphic organizer with three columns (Settler/Indigenous/Mexican perspectives). I introduce vocabulary (manifest destiny, displacement, sovereignty) with visual aids and model primary source analysis using a settler's diary entry.


Guided Practice (15 min): Pairs analyze three primary sources - settler letter, Cherokee leader's statement, Mexican citizen's account - asking: What does this person want? Fear? How does their position shape what they emphasize or omit?


Independent Practice (10 min): Students write a paragraph explaining how this event looks different from each perspective and which viewpoint is usually centered in textbooks and why that matters.


Closing (5 min): Class discussion: "Why does it matter whose story gets told?" Students share insights from hearing multiple perspectives.


Student AI Literacy Component: I created a handout based on the AI-generated "Student AI Literacy Guide" explaining where AI helps learning (timelines, vocabulary, practice questions) versus where it undermines it (interpreting sources, forming arguments). This includes citation guidance and critical evaluation questions: "Does this cite sources? Whose perspective is missing? Can I verify this?"


5. REFLECTION: HOW THIS BENEFITS STUDENTS AND EVALUATION OF IMPACT


Benefits to Students:
Critical Thinking: Multiple perspectives teach that history is contested narratives shaped by power, essential for media literacy
Equity: UDL strategies ensure access for diverse learners; perspective analysis counters textbook bias
AI Literacy: Students learn to critically evaluate AI content - transferable skills for college and career


Evaluating Impact:
I'll assess through three lenses: (1) Formative - monitoring pair discussions using thumbs up/sideways/down checks to see if students identify perspective clues; (2) Summative - the independent paragraph showing whether students understand how position influences what gets emphasized or ignored; (3) AI Literacy Growth - giving students an AI-generated summary to evaluate using the literacy guide's critical questions, revealing whether they've internalized AI skepticism skills.


What I Learned from This Course:
The ISTE course taught me that responsible AI in education isn't about better algorithms - it's about better questions. Instead of "How can AI make lesson planning faster?" I now ask: Does this cite verifiable sources? Whose perspectives does it privilege or erase? Does this advance equity or exclude learners? These questions transformed my AI tool and my teaching. The "Perspectives Analysis" feature made me realize how often I unknowingly center dominant narratives, so I now ask not just "what am I teaching?" but "whose story am I telling, and whose am I leaving out?" AI literacy isn't just a skill to teach students - it's a lens through which to evaluate every educational technology decision we make.
